# Supported recipes
Currently, the following scenarios are represented:

### Virtio-blk recipes
* [hot-plug](./virtio-blk/hot-plug.md) - demonstrates a simple virtio-blk
hot-plug to a running host.
* [fio](./virtio-blk/fio.md) - extends `hot-plug` scenario and describes how to run
fio traffic by means of `host-target` container through a hot-plugged virtio-blk
device.
* [scale-out](./virtio-blk/scale-out.md) - similar to hot-plug recipe but describing
how to hot-plug/hot-unplug 64 virtio-blk devices.

### NVMe recipes
NVMe recipes are very similar to the ones for virtio-blk device.
* [hot-plug](./nvme/hot-plug.md) - demonstrates a simple NVMe device/volume
hot-plug to a running host.
* [fio](./nvme/fio.md) - extends `hot-plug` scenario and describes how to run
fio traffic by means of `host-target` container through a hot-plugged NVMe
device.
* [scale-out](./nvme/scale-out.md) - similar to hot-plug recipe but describing
how to hot-plug/hot-unplug 64 NVMe devices and attaching 32 volumes to a single
NVMe device.


In all cases host target platform is implied as KVM.
